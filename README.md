# About me

My name's Omar, I'm from Blumenau, south of Brazil, I'm married, and the father of twins, a boy, and a girl.
I started with software development in 2003 as a trainee, focused on c++ software development, and since then I'm working with c++.
Of course, I've passed for other languages, like C#, PHP, javascript, HTML...

I've worked, most of the years, locally, I mean for local companies. WK Sistemas, and Microton developing EPR software based on Windows.
Then, with the pandemic, I had the opportunity to try to work for an international company RDI/ part of Capgemini group, allocated to the MacDonalds, United States, core team, also developing and supporting the team with C++/C# and a private script based on javascript.

This year I've been immersed in another company, with no Brazilian guys, named Zircon, almost the team was from Argentina. We are allocated to Sabre, which is an international travel software company based in the United States.

The biggest technical challenge that I've passed in these years, was a refactoring project. When working for Microton, I've worked on a vendor's software, this software runs on Windows CE, low memory, and not fast hardware. The software was based on one service and the clients, that was the pockets pcs. The data were stored in structural files, and when the service was started, these data were "indexed" in memory. For big databases, the indexing took almost 4 hours to complete. So the main purpose of that project was to decrease this time. After some time of research, we've decided to use AVL to classify these indexes, reducing the time to less than 10 minutes.
